Hello my name is Santhosh B. A candidate applying to DNS Gaming for the role of Unity developer through this technical test. This task revovles around creating a game to mimic the controls and gamplay of a casual mobile game. The game developed takes heavy inspiration form the game Evongy, hyper-casual shooter mobile game. The game is set in a space-themed man vs alien environment. All assets have been picked from https://kenney.nl/assets (CC0), additional detailing, materials and animations were all done by me. Below is a compilation of the mechanics and the features that the game provides.

The game consists of a Main menu screen, a gameplay and a game over screen. (Images are placed in order)

Mechanics inlude a slider to move the player side to side, tapping anywhere on the screen would enable the player to jump and avoid obstables and huge crowds, auto shooting based on the horizontal location the player is currently in. Buffs and Nerfs included to add more engaging elements in the game. (Images are placed in order). There are multiple types of weapons the player can choose from: Pistol, Rifle, Shotgun and Minigun.

Areas to improve:
- Consistent jumps, at the moment spamming the jump buttom
- Bullet do not 100% hit the target sometimes on different android phones, could be a Frames Per Second issue
- Better Asset optimiation, better workflow from Blender to Unity and vice versa,
- Better Sound effects

Please consider this as my application submission for the Unity developer role at DNS Gaming.
